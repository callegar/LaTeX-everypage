The "everypage" package extends LaTeX providing hooks to perform actions on
every page or on the current page. Specifically, actions are performed after the
page is composed, but before it is shipped, so they can be used to prepare the
output page in tasks like putting watermarks in the background, setting the next
page layout, etc. The package reminds in some sense "bobhook.sty" by Karsten
Tinnefeld, but it differs in the way hooks are implemented, as detailed in the
"everypage" documentation.
